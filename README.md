DFS

Problem Description

A DFS(digital factorial sum) number is found by summing the factorial of every digit of a positive integer.


For example ,consider the positive integer 145 = 1!+4!+5!, so it's a DFS number.

Now you should find out all the DFS numbers in the range of int( [1, 2147483647] ).

There is no input for this problem. Output all the DFS numbers in increasing order. The first 2 lines of the output are shown below.
